        "    -> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of indentation to define code blocks, making it easy for developers to write and understand.\n",

        "    ->In Python, an interpreter is a program that executes Python code directly, translating it into machine code line by line as the code is run. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code before execution, an interpreter processes the code in a more step-by-step fashion.\n",

        "    1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Casting)\n",
        "    Implicit type casting occurs automatically by Python when it is safe to convert one data type to another. This happens when Python internally converts a smaller data type to a larger data type, without losing any data.\n",
        "    It is automatic and does not require the programmer to do anything explicitly.\n",
        "    The conversion typically happens between compatible data types, such as from int to float, where no data is lost.\n",
        "    2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Casting)\n",
        "    Explicit type casting requires the programmer to manually convert one data type to another using built-in Python functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "    This conversion can be done between compatible or incompatible types, but the programmer must specify it clearly.\n",
        "    Explicit type casting is useful when you need to convert between types that Python does not automatically handle or when you need control over the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "    ->Conditional statements in Python allow the program to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. These statements are essential for controlling the flow of a program, making decisions, and performing different actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
        "    Purpose of conditionals statements:\n",
        "    1) Decision-Making   \n",
        "    2) Control Flow\n",

        "12) How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "    ->The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It provides an additional way to test conditions after an initial if statement. If the condition in the if statement evaluates to False, the program will check the condition in the elif block. If that condition is True, the corresponding block of code will be executed. If the elif condition is False, the program continues to check any subsequent elif statements (if any). If none of the conditions are True, the else block is executed (if present).\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "    ->The main difference between a for loop and a while loop in Python lies in how they control the number of iterations and the conditions under which they execute.\n",
        "    1)for Loop:\n",
        "    The for loop is typically used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run, or when you need to iterate over a sequence of elements (like a list, tuple, or range)     \n",
        "    2) while Loop:\n",
        "    The while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains True. The condition is checked before each iteration.\n",
        "  \n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    ->Imagine you're building a simple user authentication system, where you want to repeatedly prompt the user to enter their username and password until they enter the correct credentials. Since you don’t know how many attempts the user will need before they enter the correct credentials, a while loop would be more suitable than a for loop. This is a classic situation where the number of iterations depends on the user’s actions (whether they enter the correct information or not), making a while loop the best choice.\n",
        "    Why is the while loop suitable here?\n",
        "    The number of attempts is not predetermined. The loop needs to keep asking the user for input until they either enter the correct credentials or exceed a set limit of attempts.\n",
        "    The condition (username == correct_username and password == correct_password) is checked on each iteration, and the loop continues until the condition is met (i.e., the correct credentials are entered).\n",
        "    Why a for loop wouldn’t be suitable:\n",
        "    A for loop requires a predetermined number of iterations (such as iterating over a list or range). In this case, we don’t know how many attempts the user will need, so a for loop would not work well unless you set a fixed range of attempts beforehand (which we did in the example, but it’s still conceptually a while loop because we control the exit condition based on user input).\n",
        "    In this situation, the while loop is ideal because the iteration depends on a dynamic condition (correct credentials being entered or maximum attempts being reached).\n",
